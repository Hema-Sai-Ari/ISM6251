This repository contains the in-class examples, data and exercise files for each week of my course work for a period of 11 weeks.

##Description
The repository contains folders for each week of the course. Each week's folder contains the following subfolders:

**In-Class-Examples** - This folder contains the in-class examples that were presented during the week's lecture.

**Data** - This folder contains the data files that were used during the week's lecture and exercises.

**Exercises** - This folder contains the exercises that were assigned during the week(both In cass exercises(IC) and weekly Exercises(WE)).
